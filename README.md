Garry's Mod Chat, but bigger

# Usage
Just install the addon!

If a player types more text than the standard text box allows, the box will expand to "Big" mode.

# Caveats
No effort has been made to make this work with popular chat addons. I would be very surprised if it did.

This addon is intended to enhance the default chat box as unintrusively as possible.
